- Install newest python version (I am using 3.12 so package's versions in requirements may not work for you)
- Create virtual enviroment and download requirements (link how to do it: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
- Clone project
- Download data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/download/?acc=GSE48262&format=file
- Unzip main folder and every folder inside and create new folder named 'data' inside the project and put your data here

### Important
- Don't push data folder on github (If you named it data gitignore should skip this folder)
- Don't push to master
